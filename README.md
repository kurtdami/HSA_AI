# HSA AI Expense Tracker

An intelligent expense tracking system for Health Savings Accounts (HSA) that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (Google Gemini) to automate receipt analysis and expense categorization. The system significantly reduces manual data entry by automatically extracting and categorizing HSA-eligible items from receipt images, transforming a typically time-consuming process into a seamless, one-click operation.

The AI-powered receipt analysis:
- Automatically identifies HSA-eligible items from receipts
- Extracts key information (date, merchant, prices)
- Validates HSA eligibility based on IRS guidelines
- Reduces manual entry time from minutes to seconds
- Minimizes human error in expense tracking
